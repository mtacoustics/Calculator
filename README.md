# Calculator
A basic calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides.

My goals for this project:
- Create a functioning calculator that does the basic operations.
- Write clean code.
- Limit the amount of times that I repeat myself
- Use DOM manipulation as much as possible instead of writing it in HTML
- Would like to finish this project in a week but not setting any hard deadlines.
- Styling: Not going overboard but would like it to look good. Not super advanced but above basic.
- Testing of flexbox vs grid. I'm going to introduce myself to grid this project.
- Commit often! Update my README more often as well.

(I will be updating todos as I go and will comment them out as I acheive them but will not delete.)
ToDo's:
1. Link CSS and JS files to HTML
2. Basic formatting of HTML and CSS
3. seperate class and id's so if one changes I dont break my code
4. Write psuedo-code for JS
5. Assign ID's for JS
6. Write JS logic for calculator function.
7. Format for mobile devices.
