# Calculator
A basic calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides.

My goals for this project:
- Create a functioning calculator that does the basic operations.
- Write clean code.
- Limit the amount of times that I repeat myself
- Use DOM manipulation as much as possible instead of writing it in HTML
    (after strugglign with the etch-a-sketch project I just used HTML vs. creating the HTML in JS)
- Would like to finish this project in a week but not setting any hard deadlines.
- Styling: Not going overboard but would like it to look good. Not super advanced but above basic.
- Testing of flexbox vs grid. I'm going to introduce myself to grid this project.
    (Ended up using a combination of both. Grid worked well for the buttons and flex for the layout)
- Commit often! Update my README more often as well.

Psuedocode: (will write this out more as I go)
    Store user input by clicking the buttons into a variable, this input can be as large or as small as it can be.
    Once the user has filled input one user will then be able to select an operator (+,-,*,/)
    The value will reset to zero and await new input
    The old value will have a place holder above current input. This will allow you to see both values even after it clears.
    New value will be stored in a value
    Then a function will use what ever operator used to evaluate the math equation.

(I will be updating todos as I go and will comment them out as I acheive them but will not delete.)
ToDo's:
1. x> Link CSS and JS files to HTML 
2. x> Basic formatting of HTML and CSS
3. x> seperate class and id's so if one changes I dont break my code
4. o> Write psuedo-code for JS
5. o> Assign ID's for JS
6. o> Write JS logic for calculator function.
7. o>Format for mobile devices.
